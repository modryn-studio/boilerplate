Fill this in before running `/project-init`. It populates the Brand & Voice section of `copilot-instructions.md`.

---

## Voice

How the product sounds in UI copy, headings, CTAs, and error messages.

- <!-- TODO: voice rule 1. Example: "Short sentences. Direct. No jargon." -->
- <!-- TODO: voice rule 2. Example: "Confident without being arrogant." -->
- <!-- TODO: voice rule 3. Example: "Honest about what doesn't exist yet." -->
- Never use: <!-- TODO: list words/phrases that feel off-brand. Example: "powerful, seamless, revolutionary, unlock" -->

---

## The User

One or two sentences describing who you're building for. Be specific about what they feel, want, or hate.

<!-- TODO: Example: "Impatient people who hate bad software and don't want to do the research. They want it handed to them. Fast." -->

---

## Visual Rules

- Color mode: <!-- TODO: Example: "Dark mode base, system toggle" -->
- Accent color: <!-- TODO: Example: "Amber / Burnt Orange (#F97415)" -->
- Fonts: <!-- TODO: Example: "Space Grotesk (headlines) + Space Mono (badges/code)" -->
- Motion: <!-- TODO: Example: "Minimal. One scroll fade max." -->
- Avoid: <!-- TODO: Example: "No fake testimonials, no stock photos, no popups" -->

---

## Emotional Arc

What a visitor feels at each stage — land, read, scroll, convert.

- Land: <!-- TODO: Example: "Wait, this is different" -->
- Read: <!-- TODO: Example: "This person actually builds real things" -->
- Scroll: <!-- TODO: Example: "I want to follow this journey" -->
- Convert: <!-- TODO: Example: "I don't want to miss the next one" -->

---

## Copy Examples

Real copy to use as reference when writing UI text.

- Hero: <!-- TODO: Example: "Tools for people who don't have time for bad software." -->
- CTA: <!-- TODO: Example: "Don't miss the drop." -->
- Footer: <!-- TODO: Example: "Built by Luke. Paid for by a day job. Shipping anyway." -->
- Error: <!-- TODO: Example: "Something went wrong. Try again." -->
